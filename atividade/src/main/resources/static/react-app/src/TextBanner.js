                As an undergraduate student in Internet Systems at UNICAP, I am driven by my passion for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My hands-on experience includes proficiency in JavaScript, along with foundational skills in Python, enabling me to build complete websites and applications. While I am not a full-stack developer, I can create an effective frontend and handle backend essentials. Although I am still gaining professional experience, my current engagement in an Undergraduate Research Program has allowed me to deepen my knowledge in the field and strengthen my research abilities. I am known for my adaptability, quick learning, and teamwork skills, which I believe are essential for making meaningful contributions to any project or team.
